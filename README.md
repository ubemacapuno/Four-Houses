# Four Houses: 

This is my first project building and incorporating a server using Node.js. The server includes data for the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. If the user types in a house name and clicks the button, the API will respond back with corresponding data or an error if not found. The API will also respond with a random house and alert the user of the random house when the Sorting Hat image is clicked on.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript/Node, HTML, CSS.

## Optimizations

The purpose of this project was to get a back-end working, and to get a couple of responses from the server. In the future, I would add more responsiveness and styling (ex: have the server provide images or have colors respond to different houses being chosen, etc.). Once I get a better grasp of Express, I can incorporate that wil this repo.

## Lessons Learned:

Being able to build out simple API calls using async functions is not as hard as complicated as I thought it would be! I'm looking forward to learning more and going deeper into building APIs.
